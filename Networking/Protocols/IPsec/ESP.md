# Encapsulating Security Payload

Security Parameters Index (SPI)
* Uniquely identifies security association for ESP datagram
    * Usually chosen by destination system upon establishment

Sequence Number
* Field contains monotonically increasing counter value
    * Mandatory
    * Present in senderâ€™s packet even if receiver does not have anti-replay functions enabled
    * Transmitted sequence number may never cycle; new SA is formed prior to the 2^32nd packet on the SA

Payload Data
* Data described by the next header field
    * Mandatory; variable length
    * Encryption algorithm IV will be present here if necessary
        * If algorithm requires explicit per-packet sync, it must indicate length, structure, and location of this data

Padding
* May be required to ensure cipher text terminates on a 4-byte boundary
    * Pad length and next header field must be right-aligned within a 4-byte word

Pad length
* 8 bits; specifies size of the padding field in bytes

Next header
* IPv4/v6 number describing format of payload data

Authentication data
* Contains Integrity Check Value (ICV) computed over ESP packet.
    * Length specified by authentication function selected
    * Optional; included only if authentication service is selected
    * Authentication algorithm must specify length of ICV and comparison rules
