# 802.1Q and 802.1ad (Q-in-Q)
* **802.1Q** - 4 byte header inserted between the source MAC and ethertype field in an untagged frame
    * Ethertype set to 0x8100 — identifies following data as VLAN tag
    * 12 bits used for VLAN ID (2^12 = 4096)
    * Other bits filled in depending on QoS policy at which tag imposition occurred
    * **Tag protocol Identifier (TPID)** - identifies the frame as an 802.1Q tagged frame
    * **Tag control information (TCI)** - 16-bit field containing the following:
        * **Priority code point (PCP)** - refers to class of service IEEE 802.1p to map frame priority level
        * **Drop eligible indicator (DEI)** - May be used separately or in conjunction with PCP to indicate frames that can be dropped in presence of network congestion
        * **VLAN ID (VID)** - 12 bit field specifying the VLAN to which the frame belongs


* **802.1ad** - an additional 802.1Q header is added to the single-tagged frame
    * Second tag inserted in front of the first tag (closer to Ethernet header)
    * Ethertype set to 0x88A8 by default
    * Again, 12 bits are used for the VLAN ID and the rest are used for QoS policy
    * Theoretical limitation of 4096×4096=16777216 tags
    * **Inner tag** - closest to payload; officially called **C-TAG** (customer tag, ethertype 0x8100)
    * **Outer tag** - closest to Ethernet header; officially called **S-TAG** (service tag, ethertype 0x88A8)
