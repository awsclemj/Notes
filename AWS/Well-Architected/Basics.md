## What is the Well-Architected Framework?
* A compilation of AWS stratiegies and best practices for architecting in the cloud
* Allows architects to ask specific questions to ensure that they are building applications that are cloud-ready
* Enables customers to make informed decisions, think cloud-natively, and understand potential impacts

### General Design Principles
* In traditional environment, customers:
    * Had to guess physical infra needs
    * Expensive to test at scale
    * Fear of change
    * Could not justify experiments
    * Architecture was fixed; frozen in time
* In the cloud, customer can:
    * Stop guessing capacity needs
    * Test production at scale
    * Make experimentation easier
    * Allow architectures to evolve
    * Build data-driven architectures
    * Improve through game days

### Pillars of the Framework
* Operational Excellence
    * Focuses on the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value
    * Focus areas:
        * Prepare
        * Operate
        * Evolve
* Security
    * Focuses on the ability to protect information, systems, and assests while delivering business value
    * Focus areas:
        * Identity and access management
        * Detective controls
        * Infrastrucure protection
        * Data protection
        * Incident response
* Reliability
    * Focuses on the ability to recover from failures, dynamically acquiring compute resources, and mitigating disruptions
    * Focus areas:
        * Foundations
        * Change management
        * Failure management
* Performance Efficiency
    * The ability to use computing resources efficiently
    * Focus areas:
        * Selection
        * Review
        * Monitoring
        * Trade-offs
* Cost Optimization
    * Ability to avoid unneeded costs
    * Focus areas:
        * Cost-effective resources
        * Match supply and demand
        * Expenditure awareness
        * Optimizing over time
