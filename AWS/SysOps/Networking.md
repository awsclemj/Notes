## Networking

* Security Groups and Network ACLs
	* NACLs
		* Exam Tips
			* Your VPC automatically comes with a default NACL, and by default this NACL allows all traffic
			* You can create a custom NACL. By default, customer NACLs deny all inbound and outbound traffic until rules are added
			* Each subnet must be associated with a NACL. If you don’t explicitly associate a subnet with a NACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default NACL
			* You can associate a NACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one NACL. 
			* NACLs contain a numbered list of rules that are evaluated in order. These rules can allow or deny traffic
			* NACLs are stateless. Responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa)
	* SGs
		* Exam Tips
			* SGs are stateful, meaning that you can allow traffic in one direction and the session will be tracked
			* You do not have to create both inbound and outbound rules like with NACLs

* VPC Endpoints
	* Exam Tips
		* You can create interface or gateway VPC Endpoints for several different services
		* These act as a private network connection to the service of your choice
		* When accessing resources over the VPC endpoint, all source IPs will be private, not public

* VPC Flow Logs
	* What are flow logs?
		* Enable you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC
		* Stored in CloudWatch Logs
		* Can be created a three levels:
			* VPC
			* Subnet
			* ENI
	* Exam Tips
		* You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peered VPC is in your account
		* You cannot tag a flow log
		* After you’ve created a flow log, you cannot change its configuration
			* You can’t change the IAM role associated with the flow log
		* Not all IP traffic is monitored
			* Traffic generated by instances contacting the Amazon DNS server
			* Traffic generated by Windows instances for Amazon Windows license activation
			* Traffic to/from 169.254.169.254 (metadata)
			* DHCP traffic
			* Traffic to the VPC router
